      <h1>Dribbling a Ball</h1>
      <p>Dribbling a basketball efficiently requires a lot of hard work. Hand-eye coordination is much needed when dribbling a ball. It can takes months for people to become really skilled dribbling. One example is Kyrie
Irving. He is widely reagrded as the best ball-handler in the NBA because of how well can dribble a basketball. When he practices, he always makes sure to spend a lot of time on dribbling. It is most likely the main reason
he is the best at what he does</p>
<p> After learning basic dribbling, it becomes easier for people to more complex moves such as between the legs and behind the back.</p>
