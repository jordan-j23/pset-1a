	<h1>Getting Rebounds</h1>
	<p> Rebounds are when players grab the ball after a player from the opposing team misses a shot. Teams usually have the taller players get rebounds because they are
		higher in the air. The players that average the most rebounds are usually around 7 feet tall. An exception to that is <a href="file:///C:/Users/jjenkins/Desktop/APCSP/pset-1a/Shooting.html">Russell Westbrook </a> whose athleticism was previously mentioned.
Players can also get offensive rebounds. That happens when a player gets a rebound from a shot their teammate missed. Players who get a lot of offensive rebounds are usually unappreciated by teammates and fans.
		Despite what you may think, there is a correct way to getting a rebound.
