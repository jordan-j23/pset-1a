	<div>
	<p id="section1"> Rebounds are when players grab the ball after a player from the opposing team misses a shot. Teams usually have the taller players get rebounds because they are
		higher in the air. The players that average the most rebounds are usually around 7 feet tall. An exception to that is <a href="file:///C:/Users/jjenkins/Desktop/APCSP/pset-1a/shooting.html">Russell Westbrook </a> whose athleticism was previously mentioned.
Players can also get offensive rebounds. That happens when a player gets a rebound from a shot their teammate missed. Players who get a lot of offensive rebounds are usually unappreciated by teammates and fans.
		Despite what you may think, there is a correct way to getting a rebound.
		<ol class="list"> The steps to getting a rebound are:
			<li>Box-out Opponent</li>
			<li>Bend Knees and Jump</li>
			<li>Extend Arms in the Air</li>
			<li>Grab Ball with Both Hands and Land on Both Feet</li>
		</ol>
