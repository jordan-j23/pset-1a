	<h1>Passing the ball</h1>
	<p> Passing the ball requires high basketball IQ. You have to know exactly where to place the pass so your teammate can catch it. You also have to be sure that the defnder won't steal it.
		When players pass their teammate the ball and they score, that is called an assist. The shorter players, or the guards, on a team have more assists. There are some taller players who also get a lot of asists as well. One example is Nikola Jokic,
		who is regarded as the best passing big man in the NBA</p>
